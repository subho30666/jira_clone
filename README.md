## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I am looking for React jobs, and this is a showcase product I've built in my spare time. It serves as an excellent example of a modern, real-world React codebase.

Many showcase/example React projects are too simplistic. I believe this codebase offers enough complexity to provide valuable insights to React developers of all skill levels while still being relatively easy to understand.

## Features

- Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure
- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- A variety of custom light-weight UI components such as datepicker, modal, various form elements etc
- Simple local React state management, without redux, mobx, or similar
- Custom vite setup, without create-react-app or similar
- Custom error handling page to notify users of issues
- Centralized routes for easy maintainability and scalability

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/subho30666/jira_clone/.git`
- `npm run install`
- `npm run dev`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:5173/jira_clone/`

## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product that would be present in a real product. Since it is deployed as a SPA on GitHub, some features may not work in this setup.

### Proper authentication system üîê

I haven't set authentication yet, but I plan to add a basic token-based system.In a real product we'd want to implement a proper [email and password authentication system](https://www.google.com/search?q=email+and+password+authentication+node+js&oq=email+and+password+authentication+node+js).

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators etc. Most early stage companies tend to ignore this aspect of their product but in many cases they shouldn't, especially once their userbase starts growing.
